This directory contains preparsed examples and their default rendering, to be compared against the rendering produced by the PHP renderer.

All of the files contained in Plugins/ and most of the files (except for .txt files and repository.xml) contained in EdgeCases/ have been automatically generated by scripts/generateRendererData.php

All of the files in Plugins/ come from the corresponding plugin's ParserTest::getRenderingTests() except for the BBCodes plugins, whose tests come from BBCodesTest.
