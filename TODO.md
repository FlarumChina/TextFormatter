TODO
====

- JSParserGenerator: if all the plugins' RLA is the same, remove them from the config and use hints to bypass the if test
- Investigate the possibility of using an external CSS checker in order to enable a default "css" filter
- Consider a Twitter BBCode (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets)
- Create a way for special XSL to be evaluated at the start/end of a rendering in order to embed resources such as external scripts
- Add support for HD/other options in [YOUTUBE] ?
- Create BBCodesConfig::getBBCodeTemplate() that returns the definition of a BBCode, e.g. [URL={URL}]{TEXT}[/URL]
- Add exception codes to exceptions?
- Possibly add an "hex" filter for /^[0-9a-f]+$/iD - what would be the return value though, string or integer? does "10" return 10 or 16 (0x10)
- BBCodesConfig::addBBCodeFromExample() - try to cast defaultValue to the right PHP type
- Look into properly implementing urlencode() and rawurlencode() in JS
- Implement the concept of a plugin "tag formatter": give it a tag from the intermediate form and it returns the string that could have generated it. e.g. BBCodes's tag formatter takes <URL url="..."> and returns [URL url="..."] or [URL="..."] -- tag content might be a problem though. Can we format any start/end tag without knowing what's in between?
- Read in #phpbb-dev: ""You cannot have 3 quotes within each other" I'm getting pretty annoyed by that one now >.<" "Has some kind of system that automatically removes the innermost quote been suggested? On large posts it's almost impossible to remove it by hand without messing the tags up :<" "Right now I just copy the text and paste it within [quote] because it's easier to see, but that kinda takes away the point with the quote button" -- could be implemented as a new setting: nestingLimitAction (similar to regexpLimitAction) with possible values "ignore" (leave as text), "strip" (remove content via <i> tag) and "abort" (throw exception?) -- Actually, this case is better handled at quoting time by removing the quotes from the original message directly, e.g. remove all //QUOTE//QUOTE//QUOTE nodes. Add a class that handles that kind of manipulation, e.g. removeNestedTags($tagName, $nestingLimit)
- Fix the path in "// Start of content generated by .." comments
- Sort the "isTransparent" situation wrt <video>. isTransparent makes a tag inherit the list of disallowed children from its parent, but it cannot currently allow tags that aren't allowed by its parent. In most cases, it doesn't matter, but it prevents using <track> as the child of <video> through the HTMLElements plugin
- Add a date/datetime filter, see http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#valid-date-string-with-optional-time
- Consider allowing absolute paths in #url, e.g. "/foo.html" - also, fragment "#foo"
- Consider a way to disallow HTML elements globally or at the tag-level. For example, a way to globally disable <a> so that BBCodes that produces links are disabled
- Consider guessing a value for quickMatch based on a plugin's regexp, using its fixed part if applicable [NOTE: gotta identify escape sequences such as \d and modifiers such as a+]
- Read in phpBB's forum 'maybe you put a threshold on errors -- if there are more than, say, 10, put out an error saying "Too many BBCode formatting errors found; fix the above and Preview the post again."' -- https://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=108&t=33021&p=249335#p249335 -- NOTE: kind of sucks when those errors come from false positive from things like Autolink
- Read and consider https://github.com/Seldaek/fig-standards/blob/logger-interface/proposed/logger-interface.md
- Find a good way to test the JavaScript HTML plugins
- Add some sort of optional filtering/escaping to the variables used in repositories? htmlspecialchars(), json_encode()
- Limit URLs length to whatever browsers grok
- Add some sort of TemplateHelper::loadHTML() to load HTML templates. XSL elements should be dropped or converted to HTML elements, and curly brackets in attributes should be escaped
- Exploitable? http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?2,36997
- There are many SVG vectors, too many to chase after individually. Prevent any user-supplied data in <svg> tags (in any namespace) or add isSafeInSVG() with a very restricted set of allowed filters -- http://html5sec.org/#94
- http://html5sec.org/#49 -- http://shazzer.co.uk/database/All/Characters-allowed-inside-jsurl http://html5sec.org/#36
- Test how conditional comments in templates are rendered
- Re-enable the optimization that uses <xsl:element name="{translate('ABC','abc',name())}"/>
- PHP renderer: consider caching $node->textContent for performance, especially wrt Emoticons
- Consider *not* removing the source attribute of an attribute preprocessor
