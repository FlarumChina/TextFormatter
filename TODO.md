TODO
====

- Investigate the possibility of using an external CSS checker in order to enable a default "css" filter
- Consider a Twitter BBCode (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets)
- Create a way for special XSL to be evaluated at the start/end of a rendering in order to embed resources such as external scripts
- Create BBCodesConfig::getBBCodeTemplate() that returns the definition of a BBCode, e.g. [URL={URL}]{TEXT}[/URL]
- Add exception codes to exceptions?
- BBCodesConfig::addBBCodeFromExample() - try to cast defaultValue to the right PHP type
- Look into properly implementing urlencode() and rawurlencode() in JS
- Implement the concept of a plugin "tag formatter": give it a tag from the intermediate form and it returns the string that could have generated it. e.g. BBCodes's tag formatter takes <URL url="..."> and returns [URL url="..."] or [URL="..."] -- tag content might be a problem though. Can we format any start/end tag without knowing what's in between?
- Read in #phpbb-dev: ""You cannot have 3 quotes within each other" I'm getting pretty annoyed by that one now >.<" "Has some kind of system that automatically removes the innermost quote been suggested? On large posts it's almost impossible to remove it by hand without messing the tags up :<" "Right now I just copy the text and paste it within [quote] because it's easier to see, but that kinda takes away the point with the quote button" -- could be implemented as a new setting: nestingLimitAction (similar to regexpLimitAction) with possible values "ignore" (leave as text), "strip" (remove content via <i> tag) and "abort" (throw exception?) -- Actually, this case is better handled at quoting time by removing the quotes from the original message directly, e.g. remove all //QUOTE//QUOTE//QUOTE nodes. Add a class that handles that kind of manipulation, e.g. removeNestedTags($tagName, $nestingLimit)
- Fix the path in "// Start of content generated by .." comments
- Sort the "isTransparent" situation wrt <video>. isTransparent makes a tag inherit the list of disallowed children from its parent, but it cannot currently allow tags that aren't allowed by its parent. In most cases, it doesn't matter, but it prevents using <track> as the child of <video> through the HTMLElements plugin
- Add a date/datetime filter, see http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#valid-date-string-with-optional-time
- Consider allowing absolute paths in #url, e.g. "/foo.html" - also, fragment "#foo"
- Consider a way to disallow HTML elements globally or at the tag-level. For example, a way to globally disable <a> so that BBCodes that produces links are disabled
- Read in phpBB's forum 'maybe you put a threshold on errors -- if there are more than, say, 10, put out an error saying "Too many BBCode formatting errors found; fix the above and Preview the post again."' -- https://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=108&t=33021&p=249335#p249335 -- NOTE: kind of sucks when those errors come from false positive from things like Autolink
- Read and consider https://github.com/Seldaek/fig-standards/blob/logger-interface/proposed/logger-interface.md
- Add some sort of optional filtering/escaping to the variables used in repositories? htmlspecialchars(), json_encode()
- Limit URLs length to whatever browsers grok
- Add some sort of TemplateHelper::loadHTML() to load HTML templates. XSL elements should be dropped or converted to HTML elements, and curly brackets in attributes should be escaped
- Exploitable? http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?2,36997
- There are many SVG vectors, too many to chase after individually. Prevent any user-supplied data in <svg> tags (in any namespace) or add isSafeInSVG() with a very restricted set of allowed filters -- http://html5sec.org/#94
- http://html5sec.org/#49 -- http://shazzer.co.uk/database/All/Characters-allowed-inside-jsurl http://html5sec.org/#36
- Test how conditional comments in templates are rendered
- Re-enable the optimization that uses <xsl:element name="{translate('ABC','abc',name())}"/>
- PHP renderer: consider caching $node->textContent for performance, especially wrt Emoticons
- Conditional comments can create IE-specific exploits. Consider removing them
- Renderer::getParameter()
- PHP renderer generator: consider support for an external XPath converter (or converters, plural.) Could be used to micro-optimize some conversions (e.g. use custom PHP rather than xpath->evaluate()) and potentially unlock more dynamic rendering
- PHP renderer generator: optimize substring() in convertXPath()
- PHP renderer generator: can precompute the value from getParamAsXPath() if the param is not dynamic
- Consider adding Configurable::__set_state()
- HINT.RULE_* hints must check for the use of Tag.setFlags()
- Consider adding one callback opportunity before and after rendering. The callback would receive the XML (before) or HTML (after) and the Renderer instance
- RTE: could use custom (namespaced? or prefixed with x- or s9e-) tags with style="display:none" for metadata, e.g. <s9e:tag name="FOO" attributes='{"bar":1,"baz":2}'>....</s9e:tag> -- could even use <s9e:st/>, <s9e:et/> or <s9e:i/> to map the corresponding tags. Also, investigate wheter node events could be used to detect deletion/insertion (e.g. backspace or cut/paste)
- Consider adding an option to abort parsing when tagLimit is exceeded (good for Censor)
- Class names collisions in s9e\TextFormatter\Bundles\S18\Helper
- One cheap way to filter a CSS value would be to set an attribute preprocessor for every supported CSS attribute, e.g. /(?<!\w)color\s*:\s*(?<color>#[0-9a-f]+|\w+)/ - could be mentionned in cookbook
- Consider declaring span a formatting element in TemplateForensics even though it's not listed in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#formatting
- MediaEmbed: Bandcamp. Also, http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/search?q=-site%3Ayoutube.com+-site%3Ayoutu.be+-site%3Aliveleak.com+-site%3Abreak.com+-site%3Afunnyordie.com+-site%3Avimeo.com+-site%3Acollegehumor.com+-site%3Adailymotion.com+&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all
- Consider a plugin that matches a list of keywords. e.g. movie names link to IMDB (bad example, too many movies in existence) or select keyword get an affiliate link or Hearthstone card names have tooltips
- Systematically run ConfigHelper::optimizeArray() on a safe subset of the config, such as attribute filters(?)
- Move JavaScript\RegExp functionality to Items\Regexp
- Consider adding a way to control whether a link gets a rel=nofollow based on a hostname list
- MediaEmbed: make attributes that are present in every extract regexp required
