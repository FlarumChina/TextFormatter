Overview
========

s9e\\Toolkit is a set of self-contained, extensible tools designed with performance and ease-of-reuse in mind.

The goal for each tool is to cover 90% of use cases by itself and allow you to extend them to cover your needs, would you fall into the other 
9.9%. In 0.1% of cases, you might be better off looking for your own custom solution, or rely on a specialized library.

s9e\\Toolkit is written for PHP 5.3, uses namespaces and expects valid UTF-8 input.
